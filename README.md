# Tools

A collection of miscellaneous HTML+JavaScript tools, inspired by [tools.simonwillison.net](https://tools.simonwillison.net/).

These are simple, single-file tools that run entirely in the browser.

## Usages

Simply open any of the `.html` files in your web browser.


- [Dark Mode PDF Reader](dark-pdf-reader.html) - Read PDFs with inverted colors for easier reading in low light. Drag and drop or open any PDF file.
- [U.S. Citizenship Test (2025)](citizenship-quiz-2025.html) - Practice for the U.S. Citizenship Naturalization Test (2025 Version, 128 Questions). *Note: This is not an official resource and may contain mistakes. Please refer to [USCIS.gov](https://www.uscis.gov) for the official resource.*
- [U.S. Citizenship Test (2008)](citizenship-quiz-2008.html) - Practice for the U.S. Citizenship Naturalization Test (2008 Version, 100 Questions). *Note: This is not an official resource and may contain mistakes. Please refer to [USCIS.gov](https://www.uscis.gov) for the official resource.*
- [Textarea](textarea/) - A minimalist text editor that lives entirely in your browser and stores everything in the URL hash. Originally by [@antonmedv](https://github.com/antonmedv/textarea). Write-up via [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/27/textarea-my/).
